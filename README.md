# Creating an AWS End-of-Life Warning Dashboard

This project shows how to deploy an End-of-Life (EOL) warning dashboard that users can use to stay informed and up-to-date about EOL concerns within their account. This dashboard collects configuration information from [Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (RDS) Instances, [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) Amazon Machine Images (EC2 AMIs), and [AWS Lambda Runtimes](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
